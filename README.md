# Hi there! 👋

I'm Julia, a passionate AI and machine learning enthusiast currently studying at IT-Högskolan in Gothenburg, Sweden. I'm deeply intrigued by the endless possibilities AI offers to transform the world. My journey in this field began during my time at the National Archives, where I worked on impactful IT projects. This experience ignited my interest in the intersection of technology and archives, specifically in harnessing AI to revolutionize the archival sector.

## Education & Experience

- 🎓 Currently pursuing my degree in [[Developer in AI and Machine Learning](https://www.iths.se/utbildningar/utvecklare-inom-ai-och-maskininlarning/)] at IT-Högskolan.
- 💼 Previously engaged in a [Order application](https://sok.riksarkivet.se/bestall-till-lasesal) at the Swedish National Archives,where I dug into the client side and ease of use for both internal and external users.

## What I Do

I love delving into AI and computing, exploring the vast realm of possibilities that these fields offer. My goal is to contribute to the development of cutting-edge technologies that will shape our future.

## Projects & Contributions

Explore my GitHub repositories to see my AI and machine learning projects and courses, including [Python course](https://github.com/DeerBay/Python-Julia-Sjoholm.git), [Data Processing](https://github.com/DeerBay/Data-Processing-Julia-Sjoholm.git), and [Machine Learning]. Each project and course taught and teaches me valuable skills in Programming Languages and Technologies, and I'm always eager to collaborate on innovative ideas.

## Outside the Screen

When I'm not immersed in code, you can find me scaling rock faces 🧗, enjoying the serenity of nature, or playing hide and seek with my beloved dog 🐕. These moments of adventure and joy fuel my creativity and drive in the tech world.
